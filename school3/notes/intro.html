            in class, we went through the programming in the book, I went through reading the book on my own time.
            These are the interesting notes from when I red the book on my own time. Sure, not enough when it comes
            to a course but luckily I have had my own experience when it comes to web programming,
            not so the designing part unfortunately. Unfortunately as well, there will be times where the reader
            would have to understand some HTML to read this, could easily be found when the user Inspects via
            any browser.

        <strong>Tut 1-2</strong>

        <p>
            Tutorial 1-2 goes through the basics of HTML and CSS. In my honest opinion, I feel like a skim through.
            There was a lot of HTML content which I retained from High School but the CSS is what got to me.

        <strong>Tut 3</strong>

        <p>
            Tutorial 3 goes specifically through the process with floating elements, designing page elements.
