        What was big to me is the fact about how you can specifcially match an element when there are the same
        elements in the document. An exmaple could be that you would like to modify the element hyperlink in the
        navigation of your site but not the article itself. A reference for matching this content could be
        in the picture below.

    <!--To select an element based on its ID, use the elem#id or #id selector,
        where elem is the name of the element and id is the value of the id
        attribute.

        To select an element based on its class value, use the .class or
        the elem.class selectors, where class is the value of the class attribute.

        To select an element that contains an att attribute, use elem[att].

        To select an element based on whether its attribute value equals a specified
        value, val, use elem[att="val"].

        To answer that question, CSS assigns a numeric value to the specificity of
        the selector using the formula

        (inline, ids, classes, elements)
        -->

    <p>
        Another big one is the difference between ID and Class Selectors.

                    The ID attribute is used only on one element.

                </td>

                <td>
                    <code>

                <td>
                    The class element is used on multiple elements.
                </td>

                <td>
                    <code>

        Block Level elements all follow the Box Model:

    <!--
        Pseudo Selector

        A pseudo-class is a classification of an element based on its current
        status, position, or use in the document.

        Note that the double colon separator “::” was introduced in CSS3 to
        differentiate pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes
