<p><i>TLDR: Go to DeVry while learning the Python Programming language on the side.</i></p>
<p>My short term plan is to build read the book I posted above. My intuition tells me that I need to. The same intuition that I've been listening to a few years that have led me down the path I've been following. While reading this book, I do plan on working on other projects & preparing myself for going to college fulltime (fulltime being considered two classes with eight week session). As for five years from now, married & have my career worked out.</p>
