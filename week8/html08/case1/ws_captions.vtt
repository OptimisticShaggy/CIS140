00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 
Not a Victory of Party

3 
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000 
Symbolizing an End,

5 
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000 
as Well as a Beginning -

6 
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000 
Signifying Renewal,

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000 
as Well as Change

8 
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 
For I Have Sworn Before You

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
